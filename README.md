# Python Challenge 

## Background

In this homework assignment, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete
 2 Python Challenges, PyElections and PyFinances. 



## PyElections

* No candidate won a majority (over 50%) of the vote during the 
general election that took place on November 5, 2019. 
The 2019 Houston mayoral election was decided by a runoff on December 14, 
2019 to elect the Mayor of Space City. 

* You will be given a set of the last general election data called 
[houston_election_data.csv].
The dataset is composed of three columns: `Candidate`, `County`, and `Voter ID`. 
Python script will be used to analyze the votes and calculates each 
of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * Print the names of the two candidates who will advance to the runoff election. 



## PyFinances

* In this challenge, a Python script will be writen for analyzing the 
financial records of your company. You will be given a set of financial data called 
[budget_data.csv]. The dataset is composed of 
two columns: `Profit/Losses` and `Date`. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax 
standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

* The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each 
of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
